## Tweet 1 — HOOK

We graded wstETH.

**Grade: B (75.9/100)**

One of DeFi's most trusted assets. But our framework caught something most risk assessments miss.

Here's what we found 🧵

---

## Tweet 2 — WHAT IS IT

wstETH is Lido's wrapped staked ETH — designed for DeFi compatibility.

~9.7M supply. 98.6% on Ethereum mainnet. Deep liquidity. Used as collateral across Aave, Compound, and dozens of protocols.

So where's the risk?

---

## Tweet 3 — STRONGEST CATEGORY

**Reserve & Oracle: B (83.2)**

✅ 100% reserve ratio — fully backed
✅ Cross-chain oracle lag: 0 minutes
✅ Direct on-chain verification via Lido

This is what you want from an LST. No funny business with the backing.

## Tweet 4 — THE GOOD STUFF

The fundamentals are solid:

• 19 security auditors (Quantstamp, Sigma Prime, MixBytes...)
• 1,806 days deployed — battle-tested
• Peg deviation: only +0.048%
• 72-hour timelock on governance
• No blacklist function — censorship resistant

So why not an A?

## Tweet 5 — THE HIDDEN RISK

**Collateral Risk: C (56.1)**

Here's what most people miss:

📊 Cascade Liquidation Risk (CLR): **88.49%**

Nearly 90% of wstETH positions in lending markets could cascade liquidate in a stress event.

The asset is sound. The *usage pattern* creates systemic risk.

## Tweet 6 — MORE CONTEXT

Other flags we noted:

⚠️ LP concentration: Top 10 LPs control 99.87% of Uniswap V3 liquidity
⚠️ Token holder Gini: 0.91 — high concentration
⚠️ Volatility: 74.84% annualized (ETH-correlated)

Not dealbreakers. But worth knowing.

---

## Tweet 7 — VERDICT

**Grade B = Good - Low Risk**

wstETH is one of the safer LST options. Full backing, deep audits, proven code.

But if you're using it as collateral in lending markets, understand the cascade dynamics.

The grade reflects the asset. Your risk depends on how you use it.
